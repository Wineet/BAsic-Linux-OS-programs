seq File interface ReadMe

 Problem Statement: 
  Design a simple Char driver with open release read write operations
  Use the driver From user space to cross check the driver is working. Implement Seq_file Interface 
  which will help to get driver debug data ex: how many byte data present in char driver buffer. 
 
  add seq_file interface as a debug Mechanism for Driver. 
  create file under /proc/seq_file directory proc will be as a parent Directory
  In the proc File current number of bytes written in kernel buffer count will be there
 
 create char driver Node under /dev directory which will do actual Char driver read write operations.
 
  Note:
  Linked List is created for a single Node only to get demo for Seq file iterations.
  Node stores No valuable Data so as this Char Driver
  
  Comments are added all over Only For Educational Purpose
 
 Implementation summary: 
 		Registered as Char Driver
  		Two Device registered In the below Driver (Maintaining same buffer)
  		For debugging printk is added
 		seq_file interface is added as a debug mechanism
  		As debug Data Information Number of bytes written in Device is stored
