********* Task1 ********

Task: Create a process which will create/launch two more process.
      created two process should print "P1:I am alive" (ex: process1) 5 times. and then exit.
      After exit of two process only Launching process main should exit by printing ("bye bye").

If any exception occur, main as well as two created process should be dead



******** Task2 *******

Problem Statement: take three Global variables as (global_var1, global_var2, global_var3 ) of type unsigned long int. initial value is zero. Create 4 threads in one process. first two thread will increment these four variables 65535 times. Later two threads will decrement these four variables 65535 times.
Obtain race condition.  Main process should have two thread subroutines only one for increment and one for decrement both should be re-entrant.

At the end of each thread print variable values.

Note: to be clear two threads will executing the same subroutine(Increment/decrement) which is re-entrant.
