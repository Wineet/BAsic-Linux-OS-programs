Problem Statement: take three Global variables as (global_var1, global_var2, global_var3 ) of type unsigned long int. initial value is zero. Create 4 threads in one process. first two thread will increment these four variables 65535 times. Later two threads will decrement these four variables 65535 times.
Obtain race condition.  Main process should have two thread subroutines only one for increment and one for decrement both should be re-entrant.

At the end of each thread print variable values.

Note: to be clear two threads will executing the same subroutine(Increment/decrement) which is re-entrant.	

After achieveing above mentioned Race condition Resolve the race condition by using Mutex lock.
Also change the attributes of thread and change the stack size of the thread

output should be the default assigned value of Global variables
