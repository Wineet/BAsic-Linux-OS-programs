One program(fifo_p1.c) continuesly read from FIFO and print on terminal,
Another program(fifo_p2.c) take command line argument and write to FIFO.


In case of FIFO it is synchronised by "open" blockable call back.
After read or write operation need to close file and again open for next operation
to achieve blocking nature other wise it continuesly runs if try to read again
before closing.

Need to take care for atomic "write" operations
