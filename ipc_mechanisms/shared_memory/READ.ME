************************ Unsynchronised Shared Memory Only for shared memory Demo *************************



# only shared memory creation, attach, detach and delete operations are performed

For demo one process is creating and writing into memory and another process is reading and printing

launch first process ipc_*_process1.c becuase it is writng other wise reading will happen as 0 and memory is deleted upto that
